When students submit work through courses, you can review and grade it. AI can help grade automatically when you have answer keys.

## Finding Work to Grade

1. Go to **Students** or open a specific **Course**
2. Click **Needs Grading** or **Submissions**
3. See all pending work

Each submission shows:
- Student name
- Which lesson and project
- When they submitted
- AI grade (if available)

## AI-Assisted Grading

When your project has an answer key, AI can grade automatically:

1. Student submits their work
2. AI compares to the answer key
3. Each answer gets a score
4. Feedback is generated for wrong answers
5. You can review and adjust

### What AI Provides

| Field | What It Is |
|-------|------------|
| **AI Score** | Points AI awarded |
| **Max Score** | Total possible |
| **AI Feedback** | Explanation of what was wrong |

### Controlling What Students See

You can decide whether students see AI feedback right away or only after you review it.

## Manual Grading

You can always grade manually or override AI:

1. Open the submission
2. View the student's work
3. See AI grade (if any)
4. Adjust scores as needed
5. Add your own feedback
6. Save

For work without answer keys (open-ended responses), you'll grade entirely manually.

## Writing Good Feedback

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Give next steps">
