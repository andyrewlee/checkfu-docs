Sources are documents you upload—curriculum guides, textbook pages, standards documents. When you generate content with AI, you can reference these sources so AI creates content that matches what you're teaching.

## Why Use Sources?

Without sources, AI generates generic content. With sources, AI can:
- Match your specific curriculum
- Follow your textbook's style and approach
- Align to your standards
- Use the same vocabulary and examples your students are used to

## Uploading Sources

1. Click **Sources** in the sidebar
2. Click **Upload** or drag files in
3. Give them clear names

**Supported files:**
- PDF (textbooks, curriculum guides, worksheets)
- Images (diagrams, charts)

## Organizing Sources

Create folders to keep things tidy:
- By subject (Math, Science, ELA)
- By grade level
- By unit or chapter

Click on a source name to rename it to something descriptive.

## Using Sources When Generating

When you create a new project:

1. Click **Add Sources** in the generation dialog
2. Select a source from your library
3. Choose specific pages to reference
4. AI uses those pages as context
