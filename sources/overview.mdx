description: "Upload and organize the files that power your content"

Sources are the documents you upload to Checkfu. These can be textbook pages, curriculum guides, standards documents, or anything else you want AI to use as a reference. They live in the **Sources** section of your sidebar and can be connected to both lessons and projects.

## Why Use Sources?

If you don't add sources, AI writes general content. It won't know your textbook, your curriculum, or the vocabulary your students use. When you add sources, AI reads them and uses them as a reference — so the content it creates matches what you're actually teaching.

## Uploading Sources

1. Click **Sources** in the sidebar
2. Click **Upload Files** or drag files into the window
3. Give them clear, helpful names

**What files can you upload?**

Checkfu accepts any file type. The most common are:
- **PDF** - Textbook pages, curriculum guides, worksheets, standards documents
- **Word documents** - Lesson plans, handouts
- **Images** - Diagrams, charts, photos of handouts

<Tip>
Name your files something you'll recognize later. "Grade 3 Math Standards" is much easier to find than "Document1.pdf".
</Tip>

## Folders

Folders help you keep your sources organized. Without folders, everything ends up in one big list.

### Create a Folder

1. Go to **Sources** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Folder**
3. Give it a name

### Good Ways to Organize

Here are some ideas for how to set up your folders:

| Folder Style | Example Folders |
|-------------|----------------|
| **By Subject** | Math, Science, ELA, Social Studies |
| **By Grade** | 3rd Grade, 4th Grade, 5th Grade |
| **By Unit** | Unit 1, Unit 2, Unit 3 |
| **By Type** | Textbook Pages, Standards, Old Worksheets |

You can combine these too. For example: "3rd Grade Math → Unit 3 → Textbook Pages"

### Move Files to a Folder

Drag a source file into a folder, or right-click and choose **Move to Folder**.

## Sources in Lessons

You can attach sources to a lesson. When you do, two things happen:

1. **Students can see the source** as a reference while they work on the lesson
2. **AI uses the source** when creating content, quizzes, or tutor responses for that lesson

### How to Attach a Source to a Lesson

1. Open your lesson and go to the **Sources** tab
2. Upload a file or pick one from your library
3. Choose the specific pages that go with this lesson

You can attach more than one source to a lesson. Sources power AI generation in lessons. Add them before you try to generate objectives, content, or quiz questions.

## Sources in Projects

Sources also work when you create worksheets or slides. You upload your files as a reference, and AI uses them to create content that matches your curriculum.

<Note>
Using sources for project generation requires the **Pro** plan.
</Note>

### How to Use Sources When Creating a Project

1. Click **New Project**
2. In the generation screen, click **Add Sources**
3. Pick a file and choose specific pages
4. AI uses those pages as a guide when creating your worksheet or slides

### Common Uses

- **Match your textbook**: Upload a textbook page and say "create problems in this style"
- **Follow your curriculum**: Upload your pacing guide so AI covers the right topics
- **Align to standards**: Upload your standards document so AI matches specific standards
- **Refresh old materials**: Upload an old worksheet and say "make a new version with different numbers"

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload only the pages you need">
    Don't upload an entire textbook. Pick just the pages that relate to what you're creating. Fewer, more relevant pages give better results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use text-based PDFs when possible">
    PDFs where you can highlight and copy text work much better than scanned images. If you have a digital version, use that.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use clear scans">
    If you're scanning pages, make sure they're clear and easy to read. Blurry or crooked scans give worse results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reuse sources across projects and lessons">
    You don't need to upload the same file twice. Once a source is in your library, you can use it anywhere.
