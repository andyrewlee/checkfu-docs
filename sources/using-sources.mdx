Sources work best when you select the right pages and give AI clear direction. Here's how to get good results.

## Selecting Pages

When generating a project:

1. Click **Add Sources**
2. Pick a source document
3. Choose specific pages (don't select entire textbooks)
4. Add a label explaining what each page is for
