---

A course is a group of lessons your students work through. It's like a unit or chapter. You put lessons inside, and students go through them in order (or any order you pick).

## What a Course Looks Like

Here is an example:

```
Course: "Unit 3: Multiplication"
├── Section: "Basic Facts"
│   ├── Lesson: "What is Multiplication?"
│   ├── Lesson: "Multiplying by 2, 5, and 10"
│   └── Lesson: "Practice Quiz"
├── Section: "Multi-Digit"
│   ├── Lesson: "Multiplying 2-Digit Numbers"
│   └── Lesson: "Word Problems"
└── Final Exam
```

**Sections** group lessons together, like folders. They're optional.

**Lessons** are what students work through. Each lesson can have text, videos, worksheets, and quizzes.

## Create a New Course

There are two ways to create a course:

### Option 1: Start From Scratch

1. Click **Courses** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Course**
3. Type in a name for your course
4. The course opens and you can start adding sections and lessons

### Option 2: Generate With AI

If you have source materials (like a textbook or curriculum guide), AI can build a course outline for you:

1. Click **Courses** in the sidebar
2. Click **Generate with AI**
3. Pick the source files you want AI to use as a reference
4. Describe your target audience (example: "High school juniors preparing for the SAT, with basic algebra knowledge")
5. Open **Advanced Settings** if you want to control the structure:
   - **Number of Sections** (2 to 10, default is 5)
   - **Lessons per Section** (2 to 8, default is 4)
   - **Extract Quiz Questions** - turn this on if you want AI to create quiz questions for each lesson (you can pick how many per lesson, from 1 to 10)
6. Click **Generate**
7. Review the outline AI creates and change anything you want

<Note>
Using source materials for AI generation requires the **Pro** plan.
</Note>

## Course Settings

After you create a course, you can change these settings:

### Name and Description
- **Name**: What students see (example: "Unit 3: Multiplication")
- **Description**: A short note about what the course covers. Optional.

### Progress Mode

This controls how students move through your lessons:

| Mode | How It Works |
|------|-------------|
| **Sequential** | Students must finish each lesson before moving to the next. Good when lessons build on each other. |
| **Flexible** | Students can do lessons in any order. Good for review or independent study. |

### AI Tutor

You can pick an AI tutor for your course. This tutor helps students in every lesson. You can also pick a different tutor for a specific lesson later.

## Add Sections

Sections help you organize lessons into groups (like units or chapters):

1. Click **Add Section**
2. Type in a name (example: "Unit 1: Introduction")
3. Drag sections up or down to put them in order

You don't have to use sections. You can add lessons directly to the course.

## Add Lessons

1. Click **Add Lesson** (inside a section, or directly in the course)
2. Type in a lesson name
3. Set up the lesson content

### Reorder Lessons

- Drag lessons up or down to change the order
- Drag lessons between sections to move them
- Drag a lesson outside all sections to make it standalone

## Course Status

| Status | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Draft** | Only you and your team can see it. Students cannot. |
| **Published** | Students can see it and start working. |
| **Archived** | Hidden from everyone. Use this when you're done with a course. |

<Warning>
Students can only see **Published** courses. Keep your course in Draft while you're still building it.
</Warning>

## Publishing Your Course

When you're ready for students to start:

1. Look through all your lessons to make sure everything is right
2. Click **Publish** in the course settings
3. The status changes to **Published**
4. Students can now see the course and start working

## After You Publish

Once your course is published, you can see:
- How many students are enrolled
- How many lessons each student has finished
- Quiz scores
- How long students spend on each lesson
