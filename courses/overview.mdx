Courses let you organize your projects into a sequence that students work through. A course contains lessons, and each lesson can have worksheets, videos, text, and quizzes.

## Course Structure

A course looks like this:

```
Course: "Unit 3: Multiplication"
├── Section: "Basic Facts"
│   ├── Lesson: "Introduction to Multiplication"
│   ├── Lesson: "Multiplying by 2, 5, and 10"
│   └── Lesson: "Practice Quiz"
├── Section: "Multi-Digit"
│   ├── Lesson: "Multiplying 2-Digit Numbers"
│   └── Lesson: "Word Problems"
└── Final Assessment
```

**Sections** are optional groupings—use them to organize lessons into units.

**Lessons** are what students actually complete. Each can have content, projects, and quizzes.

## Course Status

| Status | Who Can See It |
|--------|----------------|
| **Draft** | Only you and your team |
| **Published** | Students can access it |
| **Archived** | Hidden from everyone |

<Warning>
Students cannot see Draft courses. Publish when you're ready for students to start.
</Warning>

## Progress Modes

How students move through your course:

### Sequential
- Students complete lessons in order
- Each lesson unlocks after the previous one
- Good for: Content that builds on itself

### Flexible
- Students can access any lesson anytime
- They choose their own path
- Good for: Review materials, independent study
