Lessons are what students complete. Each lesson can have text, videos, worksheets, and quizzes.

## What Goes in a Lesson

### Text Content
Instructions, explanations, or reading material. Write in the lesson editor with formatting.

### Video
Embed a YouTube/Vimeo link or upload a video file directly.

### Projects
Attach worksheets or slides from your library:

1. Click **Add Project**
2. Select from your projects (or create new)
3. Mark as **Primary** (required) or **Supplemental** (optional)
4. Drag to reorder

**Primary projects** are required for completion. **Supplemental projects** are extra practice.

### Quizzes

5. If there's a quiz, they take it
6. The AI tutor is available for help throughout
