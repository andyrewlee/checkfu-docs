---

A lesson is one step in your course. Each lesson can have reading material, videos, worksheets, quizzes, and more. This page shows you how to set everything up.

## Create a Lesson

1. Open your course
2. Click **Add Lesson** (inside a section, or directly in the course)
3. Type in a lesson name
4. The lesson editor opens with four tabs: **Sources**, **Details**, **Quiz**, and **Content**

## Sources

The **Sources** tab is where you attach files that help AI understand what you're teaching. Sources are things like textbook pages, curriculum guides, or standards documents.

When you attach a source to a lesson, two things happen:

1. **Students can see it** as a reference while they work
2. **AI uses it** to write better content, create better quiz questions, and give better tutor responses

### How to Add a Source

1. Open your lesson and go to the **Sources** tab
2. Upload a file or pick one from your source library
3. Choose the specific pages that go with this lesson

You can add more than one source to a lesson. Sources are what make AI generation work well, so add them before you generate objectives, content, or quiz questions.

## Objectives

The **Details** tab is where you set the lesson name, description, and learning objectives.

Learning objectives tell students what they will learn. They also help AI write better content and quiz questions.

### How to Add Objectives

1. Go to the **Details** tab
2. Find the **Learning Objectives** section
3. Type in what students should be able to do after this lesson
4. You can add up to 8 objectives per lesson

**Examples of good objectives:**
- "Students will be able to multiply two-digit numbers"
- "Students will identify the main idea in a paragraph"
- "Students will explain why plants need sunlight"

### Let AI Suggest Objectives

If you've already added sources, click the **Generate** button next to Learning Objectives. AI reads your source material and suggests objectives for you. You can keep them, change them, or remove them.

If objectives already exist, the button says **Regenerate** instead.

<Note>
The Generate button only works if you've added sources first. Add your source files in the Sources tab before trying to generate objectives.
</Note>

### Standards Alignment

You can connect your lesson to specific standards:
- Common Core (Math or ELA)
- Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
- C3 Social Studies
- AP, IB, or State standards

AI can suggest which standards match your lesson. You decide whether to accept or change them.

## Assignments

Assignments are the worksheets and projects that students complete in your lesson. You set these up in the **Content** tab. You can attach projects you've already made or create new ones.

### How to Add an Assignment

1. Go to the **Content** tab
2. Click **Add Project**
3. Pick a project from your library (or create a new one)
4. Choose the role:

| Role | What It Means |
|------|--------------|
| **Primary** | Students must complete this to finish the lesson |
| **Supplemental** | Extra practice. Students can skip it if they want. |

### How Students Turn In Work

You can pick how students submit their work:

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| **Digital** | Students complete the worksheet right on the screen |
| **Print and Upload** | Students print it out, do it on paper, and take a photo to upload |

### Reorder Assignments

Drag assignments up or down to put them in the order you want. A good order is:
1. Instruction or reading first
2. Practice next
3. Assessment last

## Content

The **Content** tab is also where you write the main lesson text and add video. This is what students see when they open the lesson.

### Adding Text

1. Go to the **Content** tab
2. Click in the text area
3. Type your instructions or explanation
4. Use the toolbar to add bold, lists, headings, and more

You can write as much or as little as you want. Some teachers write a short intro. Others write a full lesson plan.

### Adding Video

You can add a video to your lesson in two ways:
- **Paste a link** from YouTube or Vimeo
- **Upload a video file** from your computer

The video shows at the top of the lesson so students see it first.

### Let AI Write Your Content

If you've added sources and objectives, AI can write the lesson content for you:

1. Click **Generate** in the Content tab
2. Pick a length:
   - **Brief** (about 500 words)
   - **Standard** (about 1,000 words) - this is the default
   - **Comprehensive** (about 2,000 words)
3. Click **Generate** (or **Replace & Generate** if content already exists)
4. AI writes lesson text based on your sources and objectives
5. Read through it and change anything you want

### Teacher Context (Helps AI Do a Better Job)

You can give AI extra information about your students so it writes better content:

| Setting | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Population Type** | General, Intervention, Honors, English Language Learners, or Special Education |
| **Scaffolding Level** | How much support to include: Minimal, Moderate, or Heavy |
| **Focus Areas** | Specific skills to focus on (like vocabulary or problem-solving steps) |
| **Notes** | Anything else you want AI to know about your class |

## Adding a Quiz

The **Quiz** tab is where you add questions to test if students understand the lesson. Quizzes in Checkfu adjust to each student's level automatically.

1. Go to the **Quiz** tab
2. Add questions yourself or click **Generate Questions** to let AI create them from your sources
3. Set your quiz settings:

| Setting | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Target Questions** | How many questions to aim for (default: 5) |
| **Max Questions** | The most questions a student will see (default: 10) |
| **Mastery Threshold** | How many right answers in a row means the student "gets it" (default: 2) |
| **Allow Early Exit** | Let strong students finish early if they show mastery |
| **Hints Enabled** | Let students see hints when they're stuck |
| **Max Retakes** | How many times a student can try the quiz again |

| **Description** | A short overview of what the lesson is about |
| **Estimated Time** | How long you think it will take (shown to students) |
| **AI Tutor Override** | Use a different AI tutor than the course default, or turn it off for this lesson |
| **Previewable** | Let students see this lesson before they enroll in the course |

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add sources first">
    Sources power everything else. Add your source files before you try to generate objectives, content, or quiz questions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Put things in a clear order">
    Teach first, then practice, then test. Students do best when lessons follow a clear path.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use supplemental assignments for different levels">
    Add an easier worksheet as supplemental for students who need extra help. Add a harder one for students who need a challenge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set up the AI tutor">
    If you have an AI tutor, give it details about this lesson so it can help students better.
