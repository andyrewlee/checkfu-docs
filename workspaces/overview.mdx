A workspace holds everything—your projects, courses, students, and team members. Think of it as your classroom's digital home.

## What's in a Workspace

|---------|--------------|
| **Projects** | Your worksheets and slides |
| **Sources** | Uploaded PDFs and reference materials |
| **Courses** | Organized lessons for students |
| **Students** | Enrolled learners and their progress |
| **Agents** | Your AI tutors |
| **Settings** | Team members |
