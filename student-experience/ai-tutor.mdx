The AI tutor helps students while they work. It gives hints and guidance without just giving away answers.

## Accessing the AI Tutor

While working on a lesson:
1. Look for the **chat icon**
2. Click to open the chat
3. Type a question or explain what's confusing
4. The tutor responds with help

## What the AI Tutor Helps With

### Understanding Concepts

```
Student: "I don't understand what a denominator is"

Tutor: "Great question! A denominator is the bottom
number in a fraction. It tells you how many equal
parts the whole is divided into.

In 3/4, the denominator is 4—the whole is split
into 4 equal parts.

Can you tell me what the denominator is in 5/8?"
```

### Getting Unstuck

```
Student: "I don't know how to start problem 3"

Tutor: "Let's look at it together. What information
does the problem give you?

Sometimes it helps to underline the key numbers
and circle what the question is asking for."
```

### Checking Work

```
Student: "Did I do this right? I got 42"

Tutor: "I can see you're working on 6 × 7.
Can you walk me through how you got 42?

That will help me see your thinking!"
```

- **Encouragement** - Celebrates effort and progress
