title: "Adaptive Quiz"
description: "Quizzes that get easier or harder based on how each student is doing"
---

Checkfu quizzes adjust to each student. If a student keeps getting answers right, the questions get harder. If they're struggling, the questions get easier. This shows what each student really knows, not just pass or fail.

## How It Works

1. The student starts the quiz (usually at medium difficulty)
2. They answer a question
3. **Got it right?** The next question is a little harder
4. **Got it wrong?** The next question is a little easier
5. The quiz ends when the student shows they understand the material, or when they hit the question limit

## Difficulty Levels

Every question has a difficulty from 1 to 5:

| Level | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Basic. Simple recall or easy problems. |
| 2 | Below grade level. A bit harder than basic. |
| 3 | On grade level. Where most students should be. |
| 4 | Challenging. Needs deeper thinking. |
| 5 | Advanced. Above grade level. |

## When the Quiz Ends

A quiz stops when one of these happens:

| What Happens | What It Means |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Mastery** | The student got several hard questions right in a row. They understand the material. |
| **Target Reached** | The student answered the target number of questions. |
| **Max Questions** | The student hit the max number of questions. |
| **Student Ended** | The student chose to stop early (if you allow this). |

## Question Types

You can use two kinds of questions:

### Multiple Choice
Students pick one answer from a list.

```
What is 7 x 8?

A) 54
B) 56  ← correct
C) 58
D) 64
```

### Free Response
Students type their answer. This can be a number, a word, or a short sentence. AI grades these automatically when possible.

## Adding Questions to a Quiz

### Create Questions Yourself

1. Open your lesson
2. Go to the **Quiz** section
3. Click **Add Question**
4. Pick the question type
5. Type the question and the correct answer
6. Set the difficulty (1-5)
7. Add concept tags (like "multiplication" or "main-idea")

### Let AI Create Questions

1. Click **Generate Questions**
2. AI looks at your lesson content, objectives, and sources
3. It creates questions at different difficulty levels
4. Review each question and change anything you need

<Tip>
Make sure you have questions at every difficulty level (1 through 5). This is what makes the quiz able to adapt. If all your questions are the same difficulty, the quiz can't adjust.

## Question Settings

Every question can have:

| Setting | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Difficulty** | 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest) |
| **Concept Tags** | What skill this question tests (like "fractions" or "vocabulary"). Used to find gaps. |
| **Hints** | Clues students can ask for when stuck |
| **Explanation** | Shown after the student answers. Explains why the answer is correct. |
| **Points** | How much this question is worth |

## Quiz Settings

You control how the quiz works:

| Setting | What It Does | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Target Questions** | How many questions to aim for | 5 |
| **Max Questions** | The most questions a student will see | 10 |
| **Mastery Threshold** | How many right answers in a row means mastery | 2 |
| **Mastery Difficulty** | What difficulty level counts for mastery | 4 |
| **Allow Early Exit** | Let strong students finish early | No |
| **Extended Practice** | Give struggling students more questions | No |
| **Hints Enabled** | Let students see hints | Yes |
| **Max Hints Per Question** | How many hints per question | 3 |
| **Max Retakes** | How many times a student can try again | Unlimited |
| **Improvement Threshold** | How much better a student must do to retake | Optional |

## What Students See After the Quiz

After finishing, students see:
- Their overall score
- Which questions they got right and wrong
- Which skills they've mastered
- Which areas need more practice
- A button to retake the quiz (if you allow retakes)

## Gap Analysis

As students answer questions, Checkfu tracks how they do on each skill (using the concept tags you added). This shows you:

- Which skills the student has mastered
- Which skills need more work
- Common mistakes across your whole class

This helps you know what to review or reteach.

## What You See as the Teacher

For each quiz, you can see:
- How each student did
- How difficulty changed during the quiz (did it go up or stay low?)
- Common wrong answers across your class
- How long students spent on each question
- Which concepts are hardest for your students
