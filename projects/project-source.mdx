When you create a worksheet or slides, you can upload your own documents for AI to use as a reference. These are called **project sources**. They help AI create content that matches your textbook, curriculum guide, or standards.

<Note>
Using sources for project generation requires the **Pro** plan.
</Note>

## Why Use Project Sources?

If you don't add sources, AI writes general content that may not match what you're teaching. When you add sources, AI reads them and uses them as a reference — so the worksheets and slides it creates follow your curriculum, use the same vocabulary, and match your textbook's style.

## How to Add Sources to a Project

1. Click **New Project** (or open an existing one)
2. In the generation screen, click **Add Sources**
3. Pick a file from your source library (or upload a new one)
4. Choose the specific pages you want AI to reference
5. AI uses those pages as a guide when creating your content

### What Files Can You Upload?

Checkfu accepts any file type. The most common are:
- **PDF** - Textbook pages, curriculum guides, old worksheets
- **Word documents** - Lesson plans, handouts
- **Images** - Diagrams, charts, photos of handouts

<Tip>
PDFs where you can select and copy the text work much better than scanned images. If you have a digital version of a document, use that.
</Tip>

## Tips for Picking Good Pages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be picky about which pages you choose">
    Don't upload an entire textbook. Pick just the pages that relate to what you're creating. Too many pages makes it harder for AI to focus.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include examples of what you want">
    If you want AI to match a certain style, include a page that shows that style. For example, include a page from your textbook that has the kind of problems you want.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use clear, readable files">
    High-quality scans and clear PDFs give better results than blurry photos.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Name your files clearly">
    "Grade 3 Math Ch4 Multiplication" is much better than "scan001.pdf". Good names help you find things later.

## Common Ways to Use Sources

### Match Your Curriculum
Upload your curriculum guide or pacing document:
```
"Create a worksheet on equivalent fractions following
the progression on pages 23-25 of the curriculum guide"
```

### Copy Your Textbook's Style
Upload pages from your textbook:
```
"Generate practice problems in the same style as
the examples on page 47"
```

### Align to Standards
Upload your standards document:
```
"Create an assessment covering standard 3.NF.A.1
as described in the attached standards"
```

### Update Old Materials
Upload an old worksheet you want to refresh:
```
"Create a new version of this worksheet with different
numbers and updated formatting"
```

## Answer Keys from Sources

When you upload a source that has answer information (like a teacher's edition), AI can use it to create more accurate answer keys for your worksheets.

1. Upload the source with answers
2. Generate your worksheet
3. Then generate an answer key separately using **Generate Answer Key** in the editor toolbar
4. AI uses both the worksheet and the source to produce a correct answer key

This is helpful for problems with multiple steps where you want to make sure every step is right.

## Variations from Sources

Sources also help when you create [variations](/projects/worksheets#variations) of a worksheet. When AI makes a variation, it looks at the source material to make sure the new version:

- Covers the same topics
- Stays at the right difficulty level
- Uses similar language and formats
- Doesn't repeat the exact same questions

## Managing Your Sources

All your uploaded files live in the **Sources** section of the sidebar. You can:
- Organize them into folders
- Reuse the same source across many different projects
- Connect sources to lessons so students can see them too
