Answer keys show the correct answers to your worksheets. They make grading faster and enable AI-assisted grading when students submit work digitally.

## Creating Answer Keys

When you generate a project, you can include an answer key:

1. During generation, enable **Include Answer Key**
2. AI creates both the student version and an answer key
3. Answer key frames are marked with a special indicator

You can also generate an answer key for an existing project from the editor toolbar.

## How Answer Keys Look

Answer key frames are clearly different from student frames:
- Different background or border
- "Answer Key" label in the title
- Separated in exports

## What's Included

Depending on your content, answer keys may show:
- Filled-in answers for blanks
- Worked solutions for multi-step problems
- Correct selections for multiple choice
- Model responses for open-ended questions

## Using Answer Keys

### For Printing

When you print or export:
- **Student version** excludes answer key frames
- **Teacher version** includes everything
- **Answer key only** exports just the solutions

### For Digital Grading

When students submit work through a course, answer keys enable:
- **AI grading** - Automatic comparison to correct answers
- **Partial credit** - Recognition of partially correct work
- **Feedback** - Personalized comments based on errors
