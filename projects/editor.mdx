The editor is where you work with your projects. Open any project to enter the editor.

## Editor Layout

The editor has three areas:

### Left Panel: Pages

Shows all the pages (called "frames") in your project:
- Click a frame to select it
- Drag frames to reorder
- Right-click for options (duplicate, delete)
- Click **+** to add a new frame

### Center: Canvas

The main workspace where you view and edit:

| Action | How To |
|--------|--------|
| **Pan** | Hold Space + drag |
| **Zoom** | Ctrl/Cmd + scroll |
| **Zoom to fit** | Ctrl/Cmd + 0 |
| **Select** | Click on something |
| **Multi-select** | Shift + click, or drag a box |
| **Move** | Drag selected items |
| **Resize** | Drag the corner handles |

### Right Panel: Inspector

Shows settings for whatever you have selected:
- **Frame selected**: Title, orientation, margins
- **Text selected**: Font, size, formatting
- **Image selected**: Size, position

## Working With Frames

Frames are the pages of your project. Each frame can have its own:
- **Title** (shown in the left panel)
- **Orientation** (portrait or landscape)
- **Margins** (space around the edges)

Click the frame background (not any element) to see frame settings in the inspector.

### Answer Key Frames

Some frames are marked as **Answer Keys**. These:
- Show a special indicator
- Are excluded when students view the project
- Are used for AI-assisted grading

## Working With Elements

### Text

Add and edit text with formatting:
- Bold, italic, underline
- Font size and color
- Bullet and numbered lists
- Math equations (type LaTeX between `$` symbols, like `$x^2 + y^2$`)

### Images

Pictures can be:
- Generated by AI
- Uploaded from your computer
- Resized by dragging corners

## Printing and Exporting

### Print

1. Click the **menu** (three dots) in the left panel
2. Select **Print**
3. Use your browser's print dialog

**Tips for best results:**
- Set paper size to "Letter"

- Enable "Background graphics" for colors

### Export PDF

1. Click the **menu** in the left panel
2. Select **Export PDF**
3. The file downloads automatically
