Slides are one of the two project types in Checkfu (the other is [Worksheets](/projects/worksheets)). Use slides to make lesson presentations you can show to your class or share with students online.

## Create Slides

1. Click **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Pick **Slides**
4. Describe what you want (example: "Introduction to photosynthesis for 5th graders, with diagrams")
5. Pick your settings (see below)
6. Click **Generate**

## Slide Settings

When you create slides, you can choose:

| Setting | Options | What It Does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Style** | Playful, Standard, Academic, Visual, Custom | Changes the look of the slides. Pick "Custom" to describe your own style. |
| **Color Mode** | Black & White, Color | Color is best for presentations. Black & white saves ink. |
| **Orientation** | Portrait, Landscape | Landscape (wider) is standard for presentations. |
| **Page Size** | Letter, 4:3, 16:9 | 16:9 fits most projectors and screens. 4:3 works for older projectors. |

**Style descriptions:**
- **Playful** - Rounded containers, icons, and visual cues for younger learners.
- **Standard** - Clean headers, structured content blocks, balanced spacing.
- **Academic** - Professional layout with formal structure. No decorations.
- **Visual** - One big diagram or visual per slide with less text.
- **Custom** - Describe exactly what you want.

## Objectives

Learning objectives help AI create better slides. Before you generate, add what students should learn:

1. In the generation screen, find **Learning Objectives**
2. Type in what students should be able to do after the lesson
3. AI organizes the slides around these goals

**Examples:**
- "Students will be able to explain the steps of photosynthesis"
- "Students will identify three types of rocks"
- "Students will compare fractions with different denominators"

## The Editor

After AI creates your slides, you can change anything. The editor works the same as [Worksheets](/projects/worksheets): slide list on the left, main view in the center, settings on the right.

You can edit text, move or resize elements, add images, delete or add slides, and change fonts, colors, and sizes.

## Printing and Presenting

### Show on Screen
Open the slides in the editor to show them on a projector or screen.

### Export as PDF
1. Click the **menu** (three dots) in the left panel
2. Click **Export PDF**
3. Share the PDF with students or print handouts

### Print
1. Click the **menu** in the left panel
2. Click **Print**
3. For best results, set paper size to match your slide size

<Note>
On the Free and Starter plans, exported PDFs include a small "made with checkfu.com" footer. The Pro plan removes this.

## Templates

When you create slides, the style preset you pick acts as a template. It controls layouts, colors, fonts, and image placement. Pick one close to what you want, then change anything after AI generates the content.

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep slides simple">
    Don't put too much text on one slide. Students should be able to read it from the back of the room.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use 16:9 for screens">
    If you're showing slides on a projector or TV, 16:9 fits best. Use 4:3 only for older projectors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add objectives for better results">
    When you tell AI what students should learn, the slides come out more focused.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit after generating">
    AI gives you a good starting point. Always look through the slides and make changes for your class.
