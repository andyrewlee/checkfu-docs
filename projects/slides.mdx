Slides are one of the two project types in Checkfu (the other is [Worksheets](/projects/worksheets)). Use slides to make lesson presentations that you can show to your class or share with students online.

## Create Slides

1. Click **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Pick **Slides**
4. Describe what you want (for example: "Introduction to photosynthesis for 5th graders, with diagrams")
5. Pick your settings (see below)
6. Click **Generate**

AI creates your presentation in a few seconds.

## Slide Settings

When you create slides, you can choose:

| Setting | Options | What It Does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Style** | Playful, Standard, Academic, Visual, Custom | Changes the look and feel of the slides. Pick "Custom" to describe your own style. |
| **Color Mode** | Black & White, Color | Color is best for presentations. Black & white saves ink if printing. |
| **Orientation** | Portrait, Landscape | Landscape (wider) is standard for presentations. |
| **Page Size** | Letter, 4:3, 16:9 | 16:9 fits most projectors and screens. 4:3 works for older projectors. |

**Style descriptions:**
- **Playful** - Rounded containers, icons, and visual cues for younger learners.
- **Standard** - Clean headers, structured content blocks, and balanced spacing.
- **Academic** - Professional layout with formal structure. No decorations.
- **Visual** - One big diagram or visual per slide with less text.
- **Custom** - Describe exactly what you want in your own words.

## Objectives

Learning objectives help AI create better slides. Before you generate, add what students should learn:

1. In the generation screen, find **Learning Objectives**
2. Type in what students should be able to do after the lesson
3. AI organizes the slides around these goals

**Examples:**
- "Students will be able to explain the steps of photosynthesis"
- "Students will identify three types of rocks"
- "Students will compare fractions with different denominators"

When you add objectives, AI will:
- Put the most important ideas first
- Make sure every objective is covered
- Create slides that build toward each goal

## The Editor

After AI creates your slides, you can change anything. The editor works the same way as for [Worksheets](/projects/worksheets):

- **Left panel**: All your slides. Click to switch, drag to reorder.
- **Center**: The main area where you view and edit.
- **Right panel**: Settings for whatever you have selected.

You can:
- Edit any text
- Move or resize elements
- Add new text or images
- Delete slides or add new ones
- Change fonts, colors, and sizes

## Printing and Presenting

### Show on Screen
Open the slides in the editor to show them on a projector or screen.

### Export as PDF
1. Click the **menu** (three dots) in the left panel
2. Click **Export PDF**
3. Share the PDF with students or print handouts

### Print
1. Click the **menu** in the left panel
2. Click **Print**
3. For best results, set paper size to match your slide size

<Note>
On the Free and Starter plans, exported PDFs include a small "made with checkfu.com" footer. The Pro plan removes this.
</Note>

## Templates

When you create slides, the style preset you pick acts as a starting template. It controls:
- Slide layouts and design
- Color schemes and fonts
- Image placement and spacing

Pick one that's close to what you want, then change anything after AI generates the content.

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep slides simple">
    Don't put too much text on one slide. Students should be able to read it quickly from the back of the room.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use 16:9 for screens">
    If you're showing slides on a projector or TV, 16:9 fits best. Use 4:3 only for older projectors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add objectives to get better results">
    When you tell AI what students should learn, the slides come out more focused and useful.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit after generating">
    AI gives you a solid starting point. Always look through the slides and make changes to fit your class.
