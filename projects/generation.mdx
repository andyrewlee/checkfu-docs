3. Describe what you want
4. AI generates the content
5. Edit as needed

## Project Types

### Worksheets
Practice problems, homework, assessments. You'll get:
- Problem sets and exercises

## Writing Good Prompts

The better your description, the better the result. Include:

### Grade Level

"High school chemistry review"
"Adult ESL vocabulary worksheet"
```

### Topic and Scope
```
"Introduction to fractions - identifying and comparing"
"Photosynthesis process with labeled diagrams"

```

### Specific Requirements
```

```

## Using Sources

You can upload PDFs or documents as **Sources** to give AI more context. This helps when you want content that:
- Matches your curriculum
- Follows a specific textbook's style
- Aligns to particular standards

1. Go to **Sources** and upload your documents
2. When generating, click **Add Sources**
3. Select relevant pages
4. AI uses them as reference
