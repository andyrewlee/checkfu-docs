Worksheets are one of the two project types in Checkfu (the other is [Slides](/projects/slides)). Use worksheets to make practice problems, homework, assessments, or any printable activity for your students.

## Create a Worksheet

1. Click **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Pick **Worksheet**
4. Describe what you want (for example: "10 multiplication word problems for 3rd graders, increasing difficulty")
5. Pick your settings (see below)
6. Click **Generate**

AI creates your worksheet in a few seconds.

## Worksheet Settings

When you create a worksheet, you can choose:

| Setting | Options | What It Does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Style** | Playful, Standard, Academic, Visual, Custom | Changes the look and feel of the worksheet. Pick "Custom" to describe your own style. |
| **Color Mode** | Black & White, Color | Black & white is better for printing. Color is better for screens. |
| **Orientation** | Portrait, Landscape | Portrait is taller (like a regular piece of paper). Landscape is wider. |
| **Page Size** | Letter, 4:3, 16:9 | Letter is standard printer paper. The others are screen sizes. |
| **Target Audience** | Grade level or custom description | Tells AI who the worksheet is for |
| **Learning Objectives** | What students should learn | Helps AI create the right kind of problems |

**Style descriptions:**
- **Playful** - Rounded containers, icons, and visual cues. Good for younger learners.
- **Standard** - Clean headers, ruled lines, and balanced spacing.
- **Academic** - Professional layout with formal structure. No decorations.
- **Visual** - One big diagram or visual per page with less text.
- **Custom** - Describe exactly what you want in your own words.

## The Editor

After AI creates your worksheet, you can change anything:

### Left Panel: Pages
- Click a page to select it
- Drag pages to put them in a new order
- Right-click a page to copy or delete it
- Click **+** to add a new page

### Center: Canvas
This is where you see and edit your worksheet.

| What You Want to Do | How to Do It |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Move around the page | Hold **Space** and drag |
| Zoom in or out | Hold **Ctrl** (or **Cmd** on Mac) and scroll |
| Select something | Click on it |
| Select several things | Hold **Shift** and click each one |
| Move something | Drag it |
| Resize something | Drag the corner handles |

### Right Panel: Settings
When you click on something, this panel shows its settings (like font size, color, or position).

### Text
You can add and edit text with:
- Bold, italic, underline
- Different font sizes and colors
- Bullet lists and numbered lists
- Math equations (type LaTeX between `$` symbols, like `$x^2 + y^2$`)

### Images
Pictures can be:
- Created by AI
- Uploaded from your computer
- Resized by dragging the corners

## Printing and Exporting

### Print
1. Click the **menu** (three dots) in the left panel
2. Click **Print**
3. Use your browser's print window

**For best results:**
- Set paper size to "Letter"
- Set margins to "None"
- Turn on "Background graphics" if you want colors to show

### Export as PDF
1. Click the **menu** in the left panel
2. Click **Export PDF**
3. The file downloads to your computer

<Note>
On the Free and Starter plans, exported PDFs include a small "made with checkfu.com" footer. The Pro plan removes this.
</Note>

## Answer Keys

An answer key shows the correct answers for your worksheet. This makes grading faster and lets AI help grade student work.

### Create an Answer Key

Answer keys are generated separately from the worksheet itself:

1. Open your worksheet in the editor
2. Click **Generate Answer Key** in the toolbar
3. AI looks at your worksheet and creates answer pages

The answer key pages get added to your project with an "Answer Key" label.

### How Answer Keys Look
- Answer key pages have a special label so you can tell them apart
- They are hidden from students when they view the project online
- When you print, you can choose to include or leave them out

### What's in the Answer Key
Depending on your worksheet, the answer key may show:
- Filled-in answers for blanks
- Step-by-step solutions for math problems
- Correct answers for multiple choice
- Example responses for open-ended questions

### Using Answer Keys for Grading
When students submit work through a course, the answer key lets:
- **AI grade automatically** by comparing student answers to the key
- **Give partial credit** for work that's partly right
- **Write feedback** based on what the student got wrong

<Tip>
Always check AI-generated answer keys for accuracy, especially for word problems and multi-step questions.

## Variations

Variations are different versions of the same worksheet. The questions are different, but the format and difficulty stay the same.

### Why Use Variations?
- **Test security** - Give different versions so students can't copy
- **Different levels** - Make an easier version for some students and a harder version for others
- **Extra practice** - Give more problems on the same topic
- **Retakes** - Give a fair second chance with new questions

### Create a Variation

1. Open your worksheet in the editor
2. Click **Generate Variation**
3. Pick what kind:

| Option | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Same Level** | Different questions, same difficulty |
| **Easier** | Simpler problems for students who need more support |
| **Harder** | Tougher problems for students who need a challenge |
| **New Look** | Same content, different layout |

4. Add any special instructions (optional)
5. Click **Generate**

Each variation becomes its own project that you can edit separately.

<Tip>
Make sure your original worksheet is finished and correct before making variations. AI uses the original as a guide.
</Tip>

## Templates

When you create a new project, you can pick a style preset that acts as a starting template. The style preset controls:
- Layout and design
- Question formats
- Spacing and visual structure

Pick one that's close to what you want, and then change anything after AI generates the content.
