Worksheets are one of the two project types in Checkfu (the other is [Slides](/projects/slides)). Use worksheets for practice problems, homework, assessments, or any printable activity.

## Create a Worksheet

1. Click **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Pick **Worksheet**
4. Describe what you want (example: "10 multiplication word problems for 3rd graders, increasing difficulty")
5. Pick your settings (see below)
6. Click **Generate**

## Worksheet Settings

When you create a worksheet, you can choose:

| Setting | Options | What It Does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Style** | Playful, Standard, Academic, Visual, Custom | Changes the look of the worksheet. Pick "Custom" to describe your own style. |
| **Color Mode** | Black & White, Color | Black & white is better for printing. Color is better for screens. |
| **Orientation** | Portrait, Landscape | Portrait is taller (like regular paper). Landscape is wider. |
| **Page Size** | Letter, 4:3, 16:9 | Letter is standard printer paper. The others are screen sizes. |
| **Target Audience** | Grade level or custom description | Tells AI who the worksheet is for |
| **Learning Objectives** | What students should learn | Helps AI create the right problems |

**Style descriptions:**
- **Playful** - Rounded containers, icons, and visual cues. Good for younger learners.
- **Standard** - Clean headers, ruled lines, balanced spacing.
- **Academic** - Professional layout with formal structure. No decorations.
- **Visual** - One big diagram or visual per page with less text.
- **Custom** - Describe exactly what you want.

## The Editor

After AI creates your worksheet, you can change anything. The editor has three parts: a page list on the left, the canvas in the center, and a settings panel on the right.

| What You Want to Do | How to Do It |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Move around the page | Hold **Space** and drag |
| Zoom in or out | Hold **Ctrl** (or **Cmd** on Mac) and scroll |
| Select something | Click on it |
| Select several things | Hold **Shift** and click each one |
| Move something | Drag it |
| Resize something | Drag the corner handles |
| Add a new page | Click **+** in the page list |

You can edit text (bold, italic, lists, math with LaTeX), add images (AI-generated or uploaded), and adjust settings for any selected element in the right panel.

### Math Equations

Type LaTeX between `$` symbols. Example: `$x^2 + y^2$`

## Printing and Exporting

### Print
1. Click the **menu** (three dots) in the left panel
2. Click **Print**
3. Use your browser's print window

**For best results:**
- Set paper size to "Letter"
- Set margins to "None"
- Turn on "Background graphics" if you want colors to show

### Export as PDF
1. Click the **menu** in the left panel
2. Click **Export PDF**
3. The file downloads to your computer

<Note>
On the Free and Starter plans, exported PDFs include a small "made with checkfu.com" footer. The Pro plan removes this.
</Note>

## Answer Keys

An answer key shows the correct answers for your worksheet. This makes grading faster and lets AI help grade student work.

### Create an Answer Key

1. Open your worksheet in the editor
2. Click **Generate Answer Key** in the toolbar
3. AI looks at your worksheet and creates answer pages

The answer key pages get added to your project with an "Answer Key" label.

### How Answer Keys Work
- Answer key pages have a label so you can tell them apart
- They are hidden from students who view the project online
- When you print, you can choose to include or leave them out

### What's in the Answer Key
Depending on your worksheet, the answer key may show:
- Filled-in answers for blanks
- Step-by-step solutions for math problems
- Correct answers for multiple choice
- Example responses for open-ended questions

### Using Answer Keys for Grading
When students turn in work through a course, the answer key lets:
- **AI grade automatically** by comparing student answers to the key
- **Give partial credit** for work that's partly right
- **Write feedback** based on what the student got wrong

<Tip>
Always check AI-generated answer keys for accuracy, especially for word problems and multi-step questions.

## Variations

Variations are different versions of the same worksheet. The questions change, but the format and difficulty stay the same.

### Why Use Variations?
- **Test security** - Different versions so students can't copy
- **Different levels** - Easier version for some students, harder for others
- **Extra practice** - More problems on the same topic
- **Retakes** - A fair second chance with new questions

### Create a Variation

1. Open your worksheet in the editor
2. Click **Generate Variation**
3. Pick what kind:

| Option | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Same Level** | Different questions, same difficulty |
| **Easier** | Simpler problems for students who need more support |
| **Harder** | Tougher problems for students who need a challenge |
| **New Look** | Same content, different layout |

4. Add any special instructions (optional)
5. Click **Generate**

Each variation becomes its own project that you can edit separately.

<Tip>
Make sure your original worksheet is finished and correct before making variations. AI uses the original as a guide.
</Tip>

## Templates

When you create a new project, you can pick a style preset that acts as a template. It controls layout, question formats, and spacing. Pick one close to what you want, then change anything after AI generates the content.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| What You Want to Do | Shortcut |
|--------------------|----------|
| Undo | Ctrl/Cmd + Z |
| Redo | Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z |
| Copy | Ctrl/Cmd + C |
| Paste | Ctrl/Cmd + V |
| Delete | Delete or Backspace |
| Select All | Ctrl/Cmd + A |
| Zoom In | Ctrl/Cmd + = |
| Zoom Out | Ctrl/Cmd + - |
| Fit to Screen | Ctrl/Cmd + 0 |

Your work saves automatically.
