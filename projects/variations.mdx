Variations let you create different versions of the same project—different numbers, different questions, but the same structure and difficulty.

## Why Use Variations?

- **Differentiated instruction** - Make easier or harder versions for different students
- **Test security** - Give different versions so students can't copy
- **Extra practice** - Provide more problems on the same topic
- **Retakes** - Give a fair second chance with new questions

## Creating a Variation

1. Open your project in the editor
2. Click **Generate Variation** in the toolbar
3. Choose what kind of variation you want:

| Option | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Same Level** | Different content, same difficulty |
| **Easier** | Simpler problems for struggling students |
| **Harder** | More challenging for advanced students |
| **New Look** | Different layout or style |

4. Pick how many versions you want (1-4)
5. Add any special instructions (optional)
6. Generate

## Tips for Good Variations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with a solid original">
    Make sure your original project is complete and correct before generating variations. AI uses it as a template.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about changes">
    Instead of "make it different," try "change the numbers to use values between 100-1000" or "use different names in the word problems."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Always review">
    Check each variation before giving it to students. AI occasionally makes mistakes.

## Managing Variations

Your variations are separate projects linked to the original:
- Find them in your Projects list
- Edit each one independently
- Track which students got which version
