Projects are your educational materials—worksheets and slides. This is where you'll spend most of your time creating content.

## Finding Your Projects

Click **Projects** in the sidebar to see everything in your workspace.

Each project shows:
- **Preview** - A thumbnail of the first page
- **Name** - Click to open it
- **Last edited** - When someone last made changes
- **Creator** - Who made it

### Searching and Sorting

- **Search** by name or content
- **Sort** by recent activity, name, or date created
- **Filter by tags** to find specific subjects or units

## Creating Projects

Click **New Project** to start. You can:
- **Generate with AI** - Describe what you want and AI creates it
- **Start blank** - Build from scratch

### Project Types

When generating with AI, pick a type:

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Worksheet** | Practice problems, homework, assessments |
| **Slides** | Lesson presentations |

The type affects how AI generates content, but you can edit anything after.

## What You Can Do With Projects

Once you have a project, you can:
- **Edit** it in the editor
- **Print** or **Export PDF** for class
- **Add to a course** so students can access it digitally
- **Generate variations** for differentiated instruction or test security
- **Create an answer key** for grading

## Project Actions

Right-click a project (or click the menu icon) to:

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Open** | Open in the editor |
| **Rename** | Change the name |
| **Duplicate** | Make a copy |
| **Add to Course** | Attach to a lesson |
| **Delete** | Remove it permanently |

## Organizing With Tags

Add tags to keep things organized:
- Subject (Math, ELA, Science)
- Grade level (3rd Grade, Middle School)
- Unit or chapter
- Type (Homework, Assessment, Practice)

Click **Edit Tags** on any project to add or remove tags.
