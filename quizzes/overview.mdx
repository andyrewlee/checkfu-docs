description: "Quizzes that adjust to each student"

Checkfu's quizzes adapt in real-time. If a student is doing well, questions get harder. If they're struggling, questions get easier. This gives you a better picture of what each student actually knows.

## How It Works

1. Student starts the quiz at medium difficulty
2. They answer a question
3. **Correct?** Next question is harder
4. **Wrong?** Next question is easier
5. Quiz ends when they show mastery or hit the question limit

## When the Quiz Ends

A quiz stops when one of these happens:

| Condition | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Mastery** | Student got several hard questions right in a row |
| **Target reached** | Student hit the target score |
| **Max questions** | Hit the question limit |
| **Student ended** | Student chose to finish early |

## What Students See After

- Overall score
- Which questions they got right/wrong
- Concepts they've mastered
- Areas that need more practice
- Option to retake (if you allow it)
