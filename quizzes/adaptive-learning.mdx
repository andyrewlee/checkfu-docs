Checkfu's adaptive algorithm picks questions based on how the student is doing. Here's how it works.

## Difficulty Levels

Questions are rated 1-5:

| Level | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Basic recall, simple problems |
| 2 | Easy application |
| 3 | Grade-level standard |
| 4 | Challenging |
| 5 | Advanced/extension |

## How Difficulty Changes

**After a correct answer:**
- Difficulty goes up by 1
- Multiple correct answers in a row speeds this up

**After a wrong answer:**
- Difficulty goes down by 1
- Gives the student an easier question to rebuild confidence

**Starting point:** Most quizzes start at level 3 (medium).

## Mastery Detection

A student achieves **mastery** when they:
- Get several questions right at high difficulty (4-5)
- Show consistent performance
- Demonstrate understanding across different questions

The exact threshold is configurable in quiz settings.

## Gap Identification

As students answer questions:
1. The system tracks performance by concept
2. Concepts with low accuracy are flagged as gaps
3. You can see which skills need more work
4. Students get recommendations for what to practice

## Quiz Settings

### Session Settings

| Setting | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Max questions** | Stop the quiz after this many questions |
| **Target score** | Score that counts as "passing" |
| **Mastery threshold** | How many correct in a row for mastery |

### Retake Settings

| Setting | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Max retakes** | How many times a student can retry |
| **Improvement threshold** | Minimum improvement to allow another retake |

## What You Can See

### As a Teacher

- Class performance overview
- Common misconceptions
- How difficulty progressed for each student
- Time spent per question

### What Students See

After each quiz:
- Score and mastery status
- Concepts mastered vs. needs practice
- What to study next
- How they compared to previous attempts
