This guide walks through creating an AI tutoring agent.

## Create an Agent

1. Click **Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Agent**
3. Enter a name
4. Write the system prompt
5. Configure settings

## Writing the System Prompt

The system prompt tells the agent how to behave. Include:

### Who It Is
```
You are Ms. Chen, a patient and encouraging math tutor
who specializes in helping elementary students build
confidence with numbers.
```

### What It Knows
```
You are helping students with 3rd grade multiplication.
Focus on building understanding before memorization.
```

### How It Should Act
```
Always celebrate effort, not just correct answers.
Use visual examples and real-world scenarios.
If a student is frustrated, acknowledge their feelings
before redirecting to the problem.
```

### What It Shouldn't Do
```
Never give away answers directly. Instead, guide
students to discover the answer themselves.
```

## Example System Prompt

```
You are Coach Alex, a friendly learning coach who helps
middle school students with science.

Your teaching style:
- Use analogies and real-world examples
- Break complex topics into smaller pieces
- Encourage curiosity and questions
- Celebrate progress and effort

When a student is stuck:
1. Ask what they've already tried
2. Give a hint related to what they know
3. If still stuck, break it into smaller steps
4. Only give direct help after multiple attempts

Never:
- Give away answers without the student working
- Use condescending language
- Skip steps in explanations

Your goal is to build confident, independent learners.
```

## Agent Settings

### Basic Info
- **Name**: How the agent appears
- **Description**: Notes for teachers (students don't see this)
- **Status**: Active or Archived

### Tutoring Strategy
Pick the main approach:

| Strategy | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| Socratic | Building critical thinking |
| Hints only | Preserving struggle |
| Guided | Students who need more support |
| Direct | Quick questions, review |

### Guardrails
- **Never reveal answers**: Enforce hint-only behavior
- **Max hints**: Limit hints per question before saying "ask your teacher"

## Assigning to Courses

1. Open course settings
2. Select **Default Agent**
3. Pick your agent

## Testing Your Agent

Before using with students:

1. Go to the agent's page
2. Click **Test Chat**
3. Pretend to be a student
4. Refine the system prompt based on responses
