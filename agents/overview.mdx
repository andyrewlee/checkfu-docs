Agents are AI tutors you customize to help students as they work. Each agent has its own personality, teaching style, and rules about how much help to give.

## What Agents Do

When students work on a lesson, they can chat with the AI tutor to:
- Ask questions about the content
- Get hints when stuck
- Work through problems step-by-step
- Get explanations of concepts
- Receive encouragement

## Agent Settings

Each agent has:

### System Prompt
Instructions that define the agent's personality and behavior. This is where you tell it how to act.

### Tutoring Strategy
How the agent approaches helping:
- **Socratic** - Asks guiding questions
- **Hints only** - Gives clues but never answers
- **Guided** - Walks through problems step-by-step
- **Direct** - Gives clear explanations

### Guardrails
Rules to control behavior:
- Never reveal answers directly
- Limit hints per question
- Stay on topic

## Where Agents Work

Assign agents at different levels:

| Level | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Course default** | Agent available for all lessons in the course |
| **Lesson override** | Different agent for one specific lesson |
| **No agent** | Disable the tutor for a lesson |

## Monitoring

See how students use your agents:
- How many conversations
- What questions students ask
- Where students get stuck
- Alerts when students seem frustrated
