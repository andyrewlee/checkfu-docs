Different strategies work for different situations. Here's how each one works and when to use it.

## Socratic

The agent guides students through questions instead of telling them answers.

**Example:**
```
Student: "What's 7 × 8?"

Agent: "Good question! Let's think about this.
Do you know what 7 × 7 is?"

Student: "49"

Agent: "Perfect! So if 7 × 7 is 49, how could
we figure out 7 × 8 from that?"
```

**Best for:**
- Building problem-solving skills
- Developing understanding (not just memorization)
- Students who benefit from discovery

---

## Hints Only

The agent gives progressively more specific hints but never the answer.

**Example:**
```
Student: "I don't know how to solve 3x + 5 = 14"

Agent: "Hint 1: Start by thinking about what
operation you need to undo first."

Student: "I'm still stuck"

Agent: "Hint 2: What's on the same side as x?
How can you get rid of it?"
```

**Best for:**
- Assessment situations
- Building persistence
- Students who give up too quickly

---

## Guided

The agent walks students through problems step-by-step.

**Example:**
```
Student: "Help me solve 3x + 5 = 14"

Agent: "Let's solve this together.

Step 1: We need to isolate x. First, subtract 5
from both sides:

3x + 5 - 5 = 14 - 5
3x = 9

Does that make sense so far?"
```

**Best for:**
- New concepts
- Building procedural knowledge
- Students who need more support

---

## Direct

The agent gives clear, complete explanations.

**Example:**
```
Student: "What's the formula for area of a triangle?"

Agent: "The area of a triangle is:

A = (1/2) × base × height

The base is any side, and the height is the
perpendicular distance from that base to
the opposite corner."
```

**Best for:**
- Quick reference questions
- Review sessions
- When efficiency matters

## Choosing a Strategy

| Situation | Recommended Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Learning something new | Guided |
| Practicing skills | Socratic or Hints |
| Preparing for a test | Hints only |
| Quick questions while working | Direct |
| Building independence | Socratic |
| Struggling student | Guided |
| Advanced student | Socratic |

## Mixing Strategies

You can tell your agent to use different strategies in different situations:

```
When a student asks a simple fact, give a direct answer.

When working through a problem, use guiding questions.

When a student has tried multiple times without success,
switch to step-by-step guidance.
```

## Combining with Guardrails

| Strategy | Guardrail | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Guided | Never reveal answers | Walk through process without final answer |
| Hints | Max 3 hints | After 3 hints, suggest asking teacher |
| Socratic | Stay on topic | Redirect off-topic questions back to lesson |
