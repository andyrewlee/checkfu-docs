## Sizing Guidelines

- **Full-page screenshots** (editor views, dashboards): 1440×900 capture, save full width
- **Dialogs and modals**: Crop tight to the modal with ~16px padding
- **Small UI elements** (buttons, dropdowns): Crop tight with ~8px padding, add a subtle border or shadow so the element doesn't float
- **Format**: PNG, 2× retina
- **Max file size**: Keep under 500KB per image. Use tinypng.com or similar to compress

## Naming Convention

```
images/{section}/{descriptive-name}.png
```

All lowercase, hyphens between words. Match the doc folder structure.
